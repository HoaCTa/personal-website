        <p>
          My name is Hoa Ta, and I recently graduated with a Bachelor's Degree
          in Computer Science from University of California, Irvine. During my
          studies, I developed a wide range of skills in software development,
          completing several projects, including web and mobile applications
          using Java and JavaScript. Iâ€™m also proficient in Python and SQL. I
          love drawing realistic portraits in my free time.
